## 🔍 Overview

AGNDC is a neural surface reconstruction framework designed for binary voxel inputs. It combines:

- 🎯 GDFEM: Attention-guided feature extractor combining local window self-attention and dynamic snake convolution for enhanced voxel encoding.
- 🔄 DFFM: Dual-branch fusion module that integrates spatial and channel-wise features across scales.
- 🧩 CRPM: Lightweight post-processing module for contour-aware refinement and patch-level surface stitching.

It enables effective binary-to-mesh surface reconstruction through attention-guided feature extraction, multi-scale fusion, and contour refinement.

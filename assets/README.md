## 🔍 Overview

AGNDC is a lightweight neural surface reconstruction framework designed for binary voxel inputs. It combines:

- 🎯 GDFEM: Global Dynamic Feature Extraction (Swin Attention + Snake Conv)
- 🔄 DFFM: Multi-scale Feature Fusion with attention
- 🧩 CRPM: Contour refinement for smooth, sharp geometry

It enables effective binary-to-mesh reconstruction without relying on continuous SDF input.
